<p>My previous jobs include Associate Professor at <a href="https://www.csulb.edu/">California State University</a> and positions at NASA JPL, the Naval Research Lab, and the NSA. I received my BS from <a href = "https://www.kent.edu/">Kent State University</a> Honors College in Computer Science, and an MS and PhD from the University of Pittsburgh, also in Computer Science. My thesis was on Artificial Intelligence applications on the Nursebot Project, a robotic assistant for the elderly.
